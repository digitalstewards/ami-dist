		<h4>What is a PIPEDA request?</h4>
		<p><abbr title="Protection of Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act">PIPEDA</abbr> contains 10 <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/page-19.html#h-25" target="_blank">Fair Information Principles</a>, one of which (Principle 4.9) relates to individualsâ€™ right to access personal information data operators (such as telcos) hold about them.</p>
		<p>In general, the Act obliges data operators to give individuals access to their personal information on request. Operators have to do this in a complete and timely way, at little or no cost to the requester. <small>(Source: <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/resource/fs-fi/02_05_d_54_ati_02_e.asp" target="_blank">Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada</a>)</small></p>
