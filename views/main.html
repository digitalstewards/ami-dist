		<h4>What is a PIPEDA request?</h4>
		<p><abbr title="Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act">PIPEDA</abbr> contains 10 <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/page-19.html#h-25" target="_blank">Fair Information Principles</a>, one of which (Principle 4.9) relates to individualsâ€™ right to access personal information data operators (such as telcos) hold about them.</p>
		<p>In general, the Act obligates data operators to give individuals access to their personal information on request. Operators have to do this in a complete and timely way, at little or no cost to the requester. <small>(Source: <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/resource/fs-fi/02_05_d_54_ati_02_e.asp" target="_blank">Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada</a>)</small></p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Why should I care?</h4>
		<p>PIPEDA requests can empower Canadians to understand how companies manage the personal information entrusted to them and then make informed decisions about their commericial relationship with that company.</p>
		<p>Please see this <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2014/05/responding-crisis-canadian-telecommunications/">blog post</a> by Christopher Parsons for background.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>OK, what do I have to do?</h4>
		<p>Just fill out the form and generate a PDF letter, which you'll then mail to the indicated address via snail mail. If the company in question has a listed email address for a privacy officer, you'll also be able to send your letter electronically.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>What happens if I don't get a response?</h4>
		<p>Sometimes things can get lost in the large bureaucracies of Canadian telcos. If you don't receive a response within 30 days, follow up by sending a polite reminder to the company asking why they haven't responded to your request. If that fails to get a response, you can compalin to the federal privacy commissioner.</p>
