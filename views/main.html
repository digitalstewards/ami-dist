		<h4>What is a PIPEDA request?</h4>
		<p><abbr title="Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act">PIPEDA</abbr> contains 10 <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/page-19.html#h-25" target="_blank">Fair Information Principles</a>, one of which (Principle 4.9) relates to individualsâ€™ right to access personal information data operators (such as telcos) hold about them.</p>
		<p>In general, the Act obligates data operators to give individuals access to their personal information on request. Operators have to do this in a complete and timely way, at little or no cost to the requester. <small>(Source: <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/resource/fs-fi/02_05_d_54_ati_02_e.asp" target="_blank">Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada</a>)</small></p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Why should I care?</h4>
		<p>PIPEDA requests can empower Canadians to understand how companies manage the personal information entrusted to them and then make informed decisions about their commericial relationship with that company.</p>
		<p>Please see this <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2014/05/responding-crisis-canadian-telecommunications/">blog post</a> by Christopher Parsons for background.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>OK, what do I have to do?</h4>
		<p>Just fill out the form and generate a PDF letter, which you'll then mail to the indicated address via snail mail. If the company in question has a listed email address for a privacy officer, you'll also be able to send your letter electronically.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>What happens if I don't get a response?</h4>
		<p>Sometimes things can get lost in the large bureaucracies of Canadian telcos. If you don't receive a response within 30 days, follow up by sending a polite reminder to the company asking why they haven't responded to your request. If that fails to get a response, you can compalin to the federal privacy commissioner.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>What do I do once I get a response?</h4>
		<p>After completing this form, you have an opportunity to <a href="https://openmedia.ca/MyInfo/reminder" target="_blank">sign up to receive a reminder email</a> 30 days later. This email will ask some basic questions about your response, and will not collect any personal information. Your answers will be aggregated with others to help us better understand what happens when people file these requests.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Does this tool collect my personal information?</h4>
		<p><strong>No</strong>, this tool has been designed to run <strong>entirely within your web browser</strong>. The information you input into the form stays on your computer; <strong>we have no idea who you are, and want to keep it that way</strong>!</p>
