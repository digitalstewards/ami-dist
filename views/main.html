<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This service makes it easier for customers of Canadian companies to request for a copy of their personal information, as is their right under the <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/leg_c/leg_c_p_e.asp" target="_blank">PIPEDA Act</a>.</p>

<h1 ng-if="show">SHOW!!!</h1>
<div class="well">
<h3>What is a PIPEDA request?</h3>
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>

<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>

<h3>OK, what do I have to do?</h3>
<p>Just fill out the form and generate a PDF letter, which you'll then mail to the indicated address via snail mail. If the company in question has a listed email address for a privacy officer, you'll also be able to send your letter electronically. We recommend a physical letter, as it currently carries more authority.</p>

<h3>Why a letter?</h3>
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>

<h3>Does this tool collect my personal information?</h3>
<p><strong>No</strong>, this tool has been designed to run <strong>entirely within your web browser</strong>. The information you input into the form stays on your computer; <strong>we have no idea who you are, and want to keep it that way</strong>!</p>
